# Resources for People in Tech

I created this repository to share information and resources I find useful. I hope these can be helpful to software developers, engineers, or students, more generally anyone who is interested in software, regardless of  their background. If you notice any mistakes, or if just you want to add something that belongs here, please let me know.

## Sample Applications

### [Simple Text Editor (Java)](./java/SimpleTextEditor/src)

The aim here is to demonstrate how to create a simple _text editor_ using the Java's JFrame class, and attach some listeners to it: these will update the information displayed to the user, whenever they add or remove content from the text area, e.g. word count and position of the [caret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_navigation) relative to the text.

The functionality of this application is very limited, to say the least, but my objective here is to show **how to write code that is well organised and easy to read**. Unit tests are not present; if you want to improve your Java skills, use this as an exercise.

## Books

I believe books are a shortcut to learn good practices of software development, such as writing clean code and how to write modular applications. Sure, you could learn those practices with time, by spending hours, months, or even years writing software, but we are lucky there are people who already went through that process and have decided to share their knowledge with us, so that we can learn more easily.

Here you will find books that I believe can be useful to software developers of all backgrounds. The links are to Amazon, but you can buy them wherever you prefer. If you decide to buy using these links, know that as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. I will use this revenue to buy more books, or resources, to review and share here.

## [The Pragmatic Programmer: your journey to mastery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0135957052/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0135957052&linkCode=as2&tag=stefano03-20&linkId=bf6c467f4ef172a709a4389b7682fa57)

This is the first book I read about software development. It taught me a lot
about writing good code, debugging, and good practices used in software development.

## [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262033844&linkCode=as2&tag=stefano03-20&linkId=d9d08eeac9a3c23729823829d0a062fe)

Definitely not a book that you will finish reading in one sitting; I had it for years and I am still reading it! It is a good **reference for algorithms and data structures**, and the theory behind algorithms we use every day.

You might find some parts are hard to understand at first, but don't give up; sometimes it's just a matter of revisiting them after a few hours or days, or breaking them down into smaller concepts that are easier to digest. I personally find useful writing down or drawing what an algorithm does on each step: visualising something, rather than thinking about it abstractly, is a useful way to help your brain understand and memorise difficult concepts.

## [Code Clean: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=stefano03-20&linkId=5d8b8fdf07c486bd0c973833b22307bb)

If you want to learn how to write clean code, i.e. code that is easy to test, read, and maintain, this is the book for you. There are a lot of code samples (written in Java) throughout the book, along with explanations, to help you understand what clean code should look like and what strategies you can implement to write great code.

## [The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1942788762&linkCode=as2&tag=stefano03-20&linkId=69927b037aad4404ac41ff12029b157e)

A fantastic novel about a software engineer who has to fight the intricate bureaucracy of the company she works for, helped by a team of talented people, to deliver a complex software within the deadline.

The books wonderfully describes the obstacles people face almost every day at work in tech companies. There are lots of references to tools, good practices and priciples that every developer should be aware of. This is one of those books that has kept me glued to it for hours, so I can definitely recommend it!
